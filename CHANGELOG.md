- Removed obsolete `new` keywords.
- Added types to collection and function variables.
- Added `final` and `const` keywords.
- Replaced `null` guards with concise `?.` and `??` operators.
- Added missing null check on `dispose` for `FadeAnimatedTextKit`.

**Warning**:

- Removed `onNextBeforePause` from `ColorizeAnimatedTextKit` because it was not referenced.

## 2.0.1

- Minor updates.

## 2.0.0

- **TextLiquidFill animated text added to the packageðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰**

- **Breaking Changes**:
  Different arguments are included in the classes and `duration` has been broken into `speed` and `pause` in some classes as per their needs.

  - `duration` - Change the duration from the animation time of the complete list to single element animation time.
  - `speed` - Time between the display of characters.
  - `pause` - Delay between the animation of texts.
  - `totalRepeatCount` - Sets the number of times animation should repeat
  - `displayFullTextOnTap` - If true, tapping the screen will stop current animated text, and display it fully.
  - `stopPauseOnTap` - If true, tapping during a pause will stop it and start the next text animation.

- **Better control over Animated Texts:**  
  Callbacks added:
  - `onNext(int index, bool isLast)` - This callback will be called before the next text animation, after the previous ones pause.
  - `onNextBeforePause(int index, bool isLast)` - This callback will be called before the next text animation, before the previous one's pause.
  - `onFinished` - This callback is called at the end when the parameter `isRepeatingAnimation` is set to false.
